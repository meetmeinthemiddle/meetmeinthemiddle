- 👀 I’m interested in getting a job
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of things
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this project for a job application

This is a github account that is created to allow others to have read/write access for collaborative projects that are (a) for a job or (b) with people I don't know well enough to trust.
